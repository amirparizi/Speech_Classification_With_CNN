# Speech_Classification_With_CNN

In this project 200 voices were recorded by myself and my friend. we spoke 50 voices in english and 50 in persian. So, my data set contains 100 voices in persian and 100 voices in english split in half by the gender. These 200 voices were labeled and fed into CNN architecture.
Results indicate 98% accuracy in language classification and 99% accuracy in gender classification. Also confusion matrixes were examined for better understanding of the model.
